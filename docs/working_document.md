\# üöÄ Data Engineering + Full Stack Learning Journey



This document serves as a \*\*working log + roadmap\*\* for the project. 



---



\## ‚úÖ Setup Completed (till now)



\* Created \*\*GitHub repository\*\* for project.

\* Added \*\*README.md\*\*, \*\*LICENSE\*\*, and \*\*.gitignore\*\*.

\* Discussed high-level project vision: combining \*\*crawler, AI, Python, SQL, NoSQL, CSS, HTML, React\*\*.

\* Agreed on learning + project-based approach: we build + learn side by side.

\* Discussed \*\*data sourcing (web scraping / real-time)\*\* as first step.
