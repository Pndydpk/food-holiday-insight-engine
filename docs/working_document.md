FOODLENS
A decision intelligence engine for food merchants that detects early food trends from social buzz and converts them into actionable campaign recommendations (what to promote, when, where, and with what risk).

✅ Setup Completed (till now) — REGULARIZED

Created GitHub repository for project.

Added README.md, LICENSE, and .gitignore.

Finalized project vision: FoodLens — Food Holiday Insight Engine (data → inference engine → insights → dashboard → merchants).

Agreed on project-first, learn-along-the-way approach.

Attempted web scraping (Playwright, Selenium, Requests).

Took an engineering decision to switch from unreliable scraping to static, authoritative food holiday dataset.

Built full data engineering pipeline handling millions of records.

Updated core product goal: Shifted focus from “dashboard-first” to “inference engine-first (decision intelligence for merchants).”

📅 Learning & Project Timeline — REALIGNED STATUS
Phase 1: Data Collection (09/06/2025 – 09/27/2025)

Learn Python basics for scraping (requests, BeautifulSoup, Selenium).

Attempt real-world scraping (Playwright, Selenium).

Evaluate scraping reliability & failures.

Switch to static curated dataset for food holidays.

Load Uber Eats menu dataset (millions of rows).

✅ Phase 1 completed (with real-world tradeoff decision).

Phase 2: Data Storage (09/28/2025 – 10/11/2025)

Use SQL (SQLite) for structured storage.

Store Uber Eats menus in relational DB.

Store food holidays in separate DB.

Migrate to PostgreSQL (planned later).

Optional NoSQL (MongoDB) later.

🟡 Phase 2 partially complete (SQLite done, Postgres later).

Phase 3: Data Processing (10/12/2025 – 12/16/2025)

Pandas & NumPy for large-scale processing.

Built ETL-style scripts.

Implemented chunk-based processing.

Generated ~76M holiday–menu matches.

Analytics aggregation (holiday popularity, top dishes per holiday).

🟡 Phase 3 processing done, analytics foundation complete.

Phase 4: API Development (12/17/2025 – 12/21/2025)

FastAPI backend.

Serve analytics results via API.

Connected backend to React frontend.

✅ Phase 4 completed (API + frontend integration MVP).

Phase 5: Frontend + Dashboard (12/19/2025 – 12/21/2025)

Interactive dashboard (filters, KPIs).

React-based web UI.

🟡 Phase 5 MVP completed (basic UI + real data flow).

Phase 6: Intelligence Layer (Jan 2026 – Feb 2026)

Pivoted focus to Inference Engine (decision intelligence).

Built Baseline, Momentum, Confidence, Action Window services.

Implemented /pulse/trends API (mock social pipeline).

✅ Phase 6 Inference Engine v1 completed.

Phase 7: Deployment (Planned)

Docker.

Cloud deployment.

Monitoring.

⏳ Planned.
